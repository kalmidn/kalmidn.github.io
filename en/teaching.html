    <h1>Teaching</h1>
    <p>I teach both undergraduate and graduate-level courses in medical physics, including subjects like diagnostic radiology, radiation protection, nuclear medicine, and radiation dosimetry. My teaching emphasizes applied concepts, real-world problem-solving, and multidisciplinary collaboration across physics, medicine, and engineering.</p>
